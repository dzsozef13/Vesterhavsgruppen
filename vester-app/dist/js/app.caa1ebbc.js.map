De kan altid få hjælp fra ældre ledere. <br>\nSom tropsspejder kan man tage på kurser og lære, hvordan man leder en patrulje. I troppen lærer man en masse om sig selv og hinanden, og man får muligheder for at mødes med spejdere fra andre steder i verden. <br><br> Tropsspejdere er opdelt i patruljer, typisk af 5-6 spejdere i hver \nPatruljerne er sammensat at lederne, og med spejdere som har forskellige kvalifikationer. Hver patruljerne har en patruljeleder og assistent, som selv planlægger de spejderaktiviteter som deres patrulje ønsker at arbejde med, ud fra bl.a. materiale fra korpset.\n\n                </p>\n\n                <h1>Leder</h1>\n                <h2 data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\" data-aos-once=\"true\" data-aos-easing=\"ease-in-out\" style=\"margin:0;color:#49BFA3;\">Anne Nygård</h2>\n                <p data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\" data-aos-once=\"true\" data-aos-easing=\"ease-in-out\">Email: trop@vessterhavsgruppen.dk</p>\n\n            </v-col>\n            <v-col lg=\"6\" align=\"center\">\n            <div class=\"main-img\" id=\"groups-img\" >\n                <ImageFrame ttlText='\"Trop' filename=\"tropp.jpeg\" />\n            </div>\n            </v-col>\n        </v-row> \n    </v-container>\n        <v-container fluid class=\"groups dark\">\n        <v-row class=\"groups-inner\">\n            <v-col lg=\"6\" class=\"group-column\" id=\"anchor5\">\n                <h1>Klan</h1>\n                <h2>Torsdag kl. 19:00 - 21:00</h2>\n                <h5 data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\" data-aos-once=\"true\" data-aos-easing=\"ease-in-out\">Klanen er den næste gren i rækken.

Disse færdigheder kommer til nytte i klanarbejdet, da vi bl.a. planlægger og udfører løb for de mindre spejdere i gruppen, division, eller hvem der ellers har lysten til at deltage. Vi bruger ikke kun spejdermøderne på at lave løb, men også på at lave projekter. Projekterne kan være alt lige fra knobtavler til store byggeprojekter til tekniske finurligheder – kun fantasien sætter grænser. I klanen er der derfor masser af mulighed for at være kreativ og udvikle projekterne, men der er også plads til dem, som er mere tilbageholdende, og som bare godt kan lide sammenholdet og resten af godteposen, som følger med. <br><br>\n                Da mange af seniorspejderne også fungerer som ledere i gruppen eller centerspejdere rundt omkring i Danmark, skal der også være plads til hygge og snak. De ugentlige møder kan derfor den ene gang bestå af hygge med kaffe, the og kage og andre gange i den helt anden retning med larm, gøgl og vilde projekter.\n\n                </p>\n\n            </v-col>\n            <v-col lg=\"6\" align=\"center\">\n            <div  class=\"main-img\" id=\"groups-img\" >\n                <ImageFrame ttlText='\"Klan' filename=\"klan1.jpeg\" />\n            </div>\n            </v-col>\n        </v-row> \n        <v-row class=\"groups-inner\">\n            <v-col lg=\"4\" align=\"center\" id=\"double-image\">\n            <div class=\"main-img\" id=\"groups-img\" >\n                <ImageFrame ttlText='\"Klan' filename=\"klan.jpeg\" />\n            </div>\n            </v-col>\n            <v-col lg=\"6\" class=\"group-column\">\n                <h5 data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-duration=\"1000\" data-aos-once=\"true\" data-aos-easing=\"ease-in-out\">Selvom man er blevet senior og nu er de store, gamle og rutinerede spejdere, så holder man ikke op med at tage på lejre.

Hvis eventyrlysten bobler i dig, er det bare at komme af sted, men hvis ikke eventyrlysten allerede bobler som en gal, så skal den nok blive trænet, til den slet ikke kan få nok. <br><br>\n                Som seniorspejder vil der stadig være mulighed for at udvikle sine lederevner og spejderfærdigheder gennem kurser. Det vil også være mulighed for at få tilfredsstillet rejselysten gennem internationalt spejderarbejde og på disse måder knytte nye venskaber i byen, landet og verden over. Kurser i Danmark indenfor rammerne af Esbjerg Kommunes tilskudsregel er gratis at deltage på. Kurser er ikke kun gældende inden for spejderkorpset, men også ude i erhvervslivet.
